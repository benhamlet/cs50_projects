# CS50 Projects

This repository is a collection of C programming projects completed as part of Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) online course.

Each project is contained in its own folder and includes:
- A brief description of the task
- A `README.md` specific to that project
- Source code written in C
- Instructions to compile and run using the CS50 library

> 🔧 Note: These projects require the CS50 header file to compile. Setup instructions are provided within each individual project's README.
